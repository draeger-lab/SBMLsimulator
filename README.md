# SBMLsimulator
An efficient Java™ solver implementation for SBML

## Short description
SBMLsimulator is a fast, accurate, and easily usable program for dynamic model simulation
and heuristic parameter optimization of models encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML). For simulation it contains the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, which has
been benchmarked against the entire SBML Test Suite and all models from the Biomodels.net
database. SBMLsimulator includes a large collection of nature-inspired heuristic optimization
procedures for efficient model calibration. It provides an intuitive Graphical User Interface
(GUI) and several command-line options to be suitable for large-scale batch processing and
model calibration. SBMLsimulator runs on all platforms that provide a standard Java Virtual
Machine and is based on the open-source library JSBML. The integrated Systems Biology
Simulation Core Library can be obtained as a separate application programming library.
