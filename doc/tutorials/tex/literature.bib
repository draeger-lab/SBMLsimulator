  abstract  = {BACKGROUND:
The individual character of pharmacokinetics is of great importance in the risk assessment of new drug leads in pharmacological research. Amongst others, it is severely influenced by the properties and inter-individual variability of the enzymes and transporters of the drug detoxification system of the liver. Predicting individual drug biotransformation capacity requires quantitative and detailed models.
RESULTS:
In this contribution we present the de novo deterministic modeling of atorvastatin biotransformation based on comprehensive published knowledge on involved metabolic and transport pathways as well as physicochemical properties. The model was evaluated on primary human hepatocytes and parameter identifiability analysis was performed under multiple experimental constraints. Dynamic simulations of atorvastatin biotransformation considering the inter-individual variability of the two major involved enzymes CYP3A4 and UGT1A3 based on quantitative protein expression data in a large human liver bank (n = 150) highlighted the variability in the individual biotransformation profiles and therefore also points to the individuality of pharmacokinetics.
CONCLUSIONS:
A dynamic model for the biotransformation of atorvastatin has been developed using quantitative metabolite measurements in primary human hepatocytes. The model comprises kinetics for transport processes and metabolic enzymes as well as population liver expression data allowing us to assess the impact of inter-individual variability of concentrations of key proteins. Application of computational tools for parameter sensitivity analysis enabled us to considerably improve the validity of the model and to create a consistent framework for precise computer-aided simulations in toxicology.},

In order to perform model simulations, graphical visualizations and other software manipulations, an in-memory representation of SBML is required. We developed JSBML for this purpose. In contrast to prior implementations of SBML APIs, JSBML has been designed from the ground up for the Java programming language, and can therefore be used on all platforms supported by a Java Runtime Environment. This offers important benefits for Java users, including the ability to distribute software as Java Web Start applications. JSBML supports all SBML Levels and Versions through Level 3 Version 1, and we have strived to maintain the highest possible degree of compatibility with the popular library libSBML. JSBML also supports modules that can facilitate the development of plugins for end user applications, as well as ease migration from a libSBML-based backend.

  Abstract                 = {Genetic algorithms are playing an increasingly important role in studies of complex adaptive systems, ranging from adaptive agents in economic theory to the use of machine learning techniques in the design of complex devices such as aircraft turbines and integrated circuits. Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications.
In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics.
Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.
John H. Holland is Professor of Psychology and Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan. He is also Maxwell Professor at the Santa Fe Institute and is Director of the University of Michigan/Santa Fe Institute Advanced Research Program.},

  Abstract                 = {Background: With the increasing availability of high dimensional time course data for metabolites, genes, and fluxes, the mathematical description of dynamical systems has become an essential aspect of research in systems biology. Models are often encoded in formats such as SBML, whose structure is very complex and difficult to evaluate due to many special cases.
Results: This article describes an efficient algorithm to solve SBML models that are interpreted in terms of ordinary differential equations. We begin our consideration with a formal representation of the mathematical form of the models and explain all parts of the algorithm in detail, including several preprocessing steps. We provide a flexible reference implementation as part of the Systems Biology Simulation Core Library, a community-driven project providing a large collection of numerical solvers and a sophisticated interface hierarchy for the definition of custom differential equation systems. To demonstrate the capabilities of the new algorithm, it has been tested with the entire SBML Test Suite and all models of BioModels Database.
Conclusions: The formal description of the mathematics behind the SBML format facilitates the implementation of the algorithm within specifically tailored programs. The reference implementation can be used as a simulation backend for Java-based programs.

The optimization step typically employs heuristic global optimization algorithms, but due to measurement noise and the many degrees of freedom, it is not guaranteed that the identified single optimum is also the most meaningful parameter set. Multimodal optimization allows for identifying multiple optima in parallel. We consider high-dimensional benchmark functions and a realistic metabolic network model from systems biology to compare evolutionary and swarm-based multimodal methods. We show that an extended swarm based niching algorithm is able to find a considerable set of solutions in parallel, which have significantly more explanatory power. As an outline of the information gain, the variations in the set of high-quality solutions are contrasted to a state-of-the-art global sensitivity analysis.},

This paper describes several variants of DE and elaborates on the choice of DE's control parameters which corresponds to the application of fuzzy rules. Finally the design of a howling removal unit with DE is described to provide a real-world example for DE's applicability.},

    diagrams in a visual form. Two aspects of such a visual diagram can be distinguished:
    the layout (i.e.: the positioning and connections) of the elements in the diagram, and
    the graphical form of the elements (for example, the glyphs used for symbols, the
    properties of the lines connecting them, and so on). For software tools that also read
    and write models in SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) format, a common need is to
    store the network diagram together with the SBML representation of the model. This in
    turn raises the question of how to encode the layout and the rendering of these diagrams.
    The SBML Level 3 Version 1 Core specification does not provide a mechanism for explicitly
    encoding diagrams, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML packages to extend the Core
    specification and add additional syntactical constructs. The Layout package for SBML
    Level 3 adds the necessary features to SBML so that diagram layouts can be encoded in

    rendering of elements can be encoded. The SBML Layout package is based on the principle
    that reaction network diagrams should be described as representations of entities such
    as species and reactions (with direct links to the underlying SBML elements), and not as
    arbitrary drawings or graphs; for this reason, existing languages for the description of

The scale of these data introduces new challenges for the interpretation and extraction of knowledge, requiring the development of new computational visualization methodologies. Here, we present a new method for the visualization of time-course metabolomics data within the context of metabolic network maps. We demonstrate the utility of this method by examining previously published data for two cellular systems—the human platelet and erythrocyte under cold storage for use in transfusion medicine.

The results comprise two animated videos that allow for new insights into the metabolic state of both cell types. In the case study of the platelet metabolome during storage, the new visualization technique elucidates a nicotinamide accumulation which mirrors that of hypoxanthine and might, therefore, reflect similar pathway usage. This visual analysis provides a possible explanation for why the salvage reactions in purine metabolism exhibit lower activity during the first few days of the storage period. The second case study displays drastic changes in specific erythrocyte metabolite pools at different times during storage at different temperatures.

In conclusion, this new visualization technique introduced in this article constitutes a well-suitable approach for large-scale network exploration and advances hypothesis generation. This method can be applied to any system with data and a metabolic map to promote visualization and understand physiology at the network level. More broadly, we hope that our approach will provide the blueprints for new visualizations of other longitudinal -omics data types.},

  abstract = {Background: The concerted effects of changes in gene expression due to changes in the environment areultimately reflected in the metabolome. Dynamics of metabolite concentrations under a certain condition cantherefore give a description of the cellular state with a high degree of functional information. We used thispotential to evaluate the metabolic status of two recombinant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae duringanaerobic batch fermentation of a glucose/xylose mixture. Two isogenic strains were studied, differing only inthe pathways used for xylose assimilation: the oxidoreductive pathway with xylose reductase (XR) and xylitoldehydrogenase (XDH) or the isomerization pathway with xylose isomerase (XI). The isogenic relationshipbetween the two strains ascertains that the observed responses are a result of the particular xylose pathwayand not due to unknown changes in regulatory systems. An increased understanding of the physiologicalstate of these strains is important for further development of efficient pentose-utilizing strains for bioethanolproduction.Results: Using LC-MS/MS we determined the dynamics in the concentrations of intracellular metabolites incentral carbon metabolism, nine amino acids, the purine nucleotides and redox cofactors. The generalresponse to the transition from glucose to xylose was increased concentrations of amino acids and TCA-cycleintermediates, and decreased concentrations of sugar phosphates and redox cofactors. The two strainsinvestigated had significantly different uptake rates of xylose which led to an enhanced response in theXI-strain. Despite the difference in xylose uptake rate, the adenylate energy charge remained high and stablearound 0.8 in both strains. In contrast to the adenylate pool, large changes were observed in the guanylatepool.Conclusions: The low uptake of xylose by the XI-strain led to several distinguished responses: depletion ofkey metabolites in glycolysis and NADPH, a reduced GTP/GDP ratio and accumulation of PEP and aromaticamino acids. These changes are strong indicators of carbon starvation. The XR/XDH-strain displayed few suchtraits. The coexistence of these traits and a stable adenylate charge indicates that xylose supplies energy tothe cells but does not suppress a response similar to carbon starvation. Particular signals may play a role inthe latter, of which the GTP/GMP ratio could be a candidate as it decreased significantly in both strains. {\textcopyright} 2012 Bergdahl et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

  abstract  = {Escher is a web application for visualizing data on biological
        pathways. Three key features make Escher a uniquely effective tool for
        pathway visualization. First, users can rapidly design new pathway maps.
        Escher provides pathway suggestions based on user data and genome-scale
        models, so users can draw pathways in a semi-automated way. Second, users
        can visualize data related to genes or proteins on the associated reactions
        and pathways, using rules that define which enzmyes catalyze each reaction.
        Thus, users can identify trends in common genomic data types (e.g., RNA-Seq,
        proteomics, ChIP) in conjunction with metabolite- and reaction-oriented data
        types (e.g., metabolomics, fluxomics). Third, Escher harnesses the strengths
        of web technologies (SVG, D3, developer tools) so that visualizations can be
        rapidly adapted, extended, shared, and embedded. This paper provides
        examples of each of these features and explains how the development approach
        used for Escher can be used to guide the development of future visualization
        tools.},

  abstract = {Computational modelling has become increasingly common in life science research. To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models) guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world’s largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.},

  abstract      = {Understanding of the logic and dynamics of gene- regulatory and biochemical networks is a major challenge of systems biology. To facilitate this research topic, we have developed a modeling/simulating tool called CellDesigner. CellDesigner primarily has capab ilities to visualize, model, and simulate gene-regulatory and biochemical networks. Two major characteristics embedded in CellDesigner boost its usability to create/import/export models: 1) solidly defined and comprehensive graphical representation (systems biology graphical notation) of network models and 2) systems biology markup language (SBML) as a model-describing basis, which function as intertool media to import/export SBML-based models. In addition, since its initial release in 2004, we have extended various capabilities of CellDesigner. For example, we integrated other Systems Biology Workbench enabled simulation/analysis software packages. CellDesigner also sup- ports simulation and parameter search, supported by integra- tion with SBML ODE Solver, enabling users to simulate through our sophisticated graphical user interface. Users can also browse and modify existing models by referring to existing databases directly through CellDesigner. Those extended functions empower CellDesigner as not only a modeling/ simulating tool but also an integrated analysis suite. Cell- Designer is implemented in Java and thus supports various platforms (i.e., Windows, Linux, and MacOS X). CellDesigner is freely available via our Web site.},

  abstract = {Background:
        To understand the dynamic behavior of cellular systems, mathematical
        modeling is often necessary and comprises three steps: (1) experimental
        measurement of participating molecules, (2) assignment of rate laws to each
        reaction, and (3) parameter calibration with respect to the measurements.
        In each of these steps the modeler is confronted with a plethora of
        alternative approaches, e.g., the selection of approximative rate laws in
        step two as specific equations are often unknown, or the choice of an
        estimation procedure with its specific settings in step three. This overall
        process with its numerous choices and the mutual influence between them
        makes it hard to single out the best modeling approach for a given problem.
        
        Results: 
        We investigate the modeling process using multiple kinetic equations
        together with various parameter optimization methods for a
        well-characterized example network, the biosynthesis of valine and leucine
        in \emph{C.~glutamicum}. For this purpose, we derive seven dynamic models
        based on generalized mass action, Michaelis-Menten and convenience kinetics
        as well as the stochastic Langevin equation. In addition, we introduce two
        modeling approaches for feedback inhibition to the mass action kinetics. The
        parameters of each model are estimated using eight optimization strategies.
        To determine the most promising modeling approaches together with
        the best optimization algorithms, we carry out a two-step benchmark:
        (1) coarse-grained comparison of the algorithms on all models and
        (2) fine-grained tuning of the best optimization algorithms and models.
        To analyze the space of the best parameters found for each model,
        we apply clustering, variance, and correlation analysis.
        
        Conclusion:
        A mixed model based on the convenience rate law and the Michaelis-Menten
        equation, in which all reactions are assumed to be reversible, is
        the most suitable deterministic modeling approach followed by a reversible
        generalized mass action kinetics model. A Langevin model is advisable
        to take stochastic effects into account. To estimate the model parameters,
        three algorithms are particularly useful: For first attempts the
        settings-free Tribes algorithm yields valuable results. Particle
        swarm optimization and differential evolution provide significantly
        better results with appropriate settings.},

        (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/miriam) provides unique, perennial and location-independent
        identifiers for data used in the biomedical domain. At its core is
        a shared catalogue of data collections, for each of which an individual
        namespace is created, and extensive metadata recorded. This namespace
        allows the generation of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs) to uniquely
        identify any record in a collection. Moreover, various services are
        provided to facilitate the creation and resolution of the identifiers.
        Since its launch in 2005, the system has evolved in terms of the
        structure of the identifiers provided, the software infrastructure,
        the number of data collections recorded, as well as the scope of
        the Registry itself. We describe here the new parallel identification
        scheme and the updated supporting software infrastructure. We also
        introduce the new Identifiers.org service (http://identifiers.org)
        that is built upon the information stored in the Registry and which 
        provides directly resolvable identifiers, in the form of Uniform
