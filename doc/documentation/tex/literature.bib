  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The transcriptional regulation of a metazoan gene depends
	on the cooperative action of multiple transcription factors that
	bind to cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) located in the neighborhood
	of the gene. By integrating multiple signals, CRMs confer an organism
	specific spatial and temporal rate of transcription. RESULTS: Based
	on the hypothesis that genes that are needed in exactly the same
	conditions might share similar regulatory switches, we have developed
	a novel methodology to find CRMs in a set of coexpressed or coregulated
	genes. The ModuleSearcher algorithm finds for a given gene set the
	best scoring combination of transcription factor binding sites within
	a sequence window using an A(*)procedure for tree searching. To keep
	the level of noise low, we use DNA sequences that are most likely
	to contain functional cis-regulatory information, namely conserved
	regions between human and mouse orthologous genes. The ModuleScanner
	performs genomic searches with a predicted CRM or with a user-defined
	CRM known from the literature to find possible target genes. The
	validity of a set of putative targets is checked using Gene Ontology
	annotations. We demonstrate the use and effectiveness of the ModuleSearcher
	and ModuleScanner algorithms and test their specificity and sensitivity
	on semi-artificial data. Next, we search for a module in a cluster
	of gene expression profiles of human cell cycle genes. AVAILABILITY:
	The ModuleSearcher is available as a web service within the TOUCAN
	workbench for regulatory sequence analysis, which can be downloaded

	in the translocation of the nucleosome core in already repaired DNA
	strands. Whereas methylation processes are needed for restrictions,
	acetylation and phosphorylation reactions are presumably necessary
	for DNA reduplication and DNA transcription.},

	of a coordinated regulation of transcription and replication. These

	proportion of noncoding DNA within the nucleus. In this study, we
	provide a direct measurement of the number of genes in human and
	mouse. We have taken advantage of the fact that many mammalian genes
	are associated with CpG islands whose distinctive properties allow
	their physical separation from bulk DNA. Our results suggest that
	there are approximately 45,000 CpG islands per haploid genome in
	humans and 37,000 in the mouse. Sequence comparison confirms that
	about 20\% of the human CpG islands are absent from the homologous
	mouse genes. Analysis of a selection of genes suggests that both
	human and mouse are losing CpG islands over evolutionary time due
	to de novo methylation in the germ line followed by CpG loss through
	mutation. This process appears to be more rapid in rodents. Combining
	the number of CpG islands with the proportion of island-associated

  abstract = {Polyubiquitination is a death signal for proteins and condemns proteins
	to subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. However, recent
	studies imply that monoubiquitination and polyubiquitination of proteins
	do not necessarily result in protein degradation but play an important
	role in the execution of various biological events such as signal
	transduction and transcription. Ubiquitin was originally identified
	as a moiety attached to histones, and this as well as other histone
	modifications may play an important role for transcription and various
	other DNA-dependent processes. Considerable progress has been made
	in linking several histone modifications with chromatin dynamics
	in transcription. Acetylation of histones has been intimately linked
	to activation of transcription, while deacetylation is concomitant
	with repression of transcription. Although other histone modifications
	such as methylation, phosphorylation, and ubiquitination have been
	correlated with transcriptionally competent or inactive chromatin,
	the enzymes that mediate these modifications are only now being discovered.
	The identification of these histone-modifying enzymes may provide
	valuable insights into the role and function of histone modifications
	such as ubiquitination in transcription as well as other DNA-dependent
	processes. Recently, we have used various in vitro assays to show
	that the coactivator TAF(II)250 possesses both ubiquitin-activating
	and ubiquitin-conjugating activities, which monoubiquitinate histone
	H1. Here, we describe the methods used to identify this bifunctional
	enzyme: (1) in-gel activity assay; (2) protein-transfer membrane
	activity assay; and (3) in-solution activity assay. These methods
	have been successfully used to identify various histone-modifying
	enzymes and protein kinases. In this article we contribute a short
	review of the history of the methods used to study ubiquitination
	of proteins and histone modification. We provide protocols for in-gel,
	protein-transfer membrane, and in-solution ubiquitination assays.
	A discussion of the general use of the provided protocols, their
	limitations, and future perspectives are presented. The described
	methods provide useful tools for the identification of not only novel
	histone-modifying enzymes but also other protein-modifying enzymes
	that act in a variety of biological events.},

	large dimensions of the feature space and in addition have trouble
	dealing with different feature types or noisy data. In this paper,
	an algorithm is proposed that extracts a set of so called mixed fuzzy
	rules. These rules can be extracted from feature spaces with diverse
	types of attributes and handle the corresponding different types
	of constraints in parallel. The extracted rules depend on individual
	subsets of only few attributes, which is especially useful in high
	dimensional feature spaces. The algorithm along with results on several
	classification benchmarks is presented and how this method can be
	extended to handle outliers or noisy training instances as well is
	sketched briefly.},

	for probabilistic neural networks, a special type of radial basis

	new hidden units whenever necessary and adjusts the shape of already
	existing units individually to minimize the risk of misclassification.
	This leads to smaller networks compared to classical PNNs and therefore
	enables the use of large data sets. Using eight classification benchmarks
	from the StatLog project, the new algorithm is compared to other
	state of the art classification methods. It is demonstrated that
	the proposed algorithm generates probabilistic neural networks that
	achieve a comparable classification performance on these data sets.
	Only two rather uncritical parameters are required to be adjusted
	manually and there is no danger of overtraining - the algorithm clearly
	indicates the end of training. In addition, the networks generated
	are small due to the lack of redundant neurons in the hidden layer.},

  abstract = {CpG island methylation plays an important role in epigenetic gene
	control during mammalian development and is frequently altered in
	disease situations such as cancer. The majority of CpG islands is
	normally unmethylated, but a sizeable fraction is prone to become
	methylated in various cell types and pathological situations. The
	goal of this study is to show that a computational epigenetics approach
	can discriminate between CpG islands that are prone to methylation
	from those that remain unmethylated. We develop a bioinformatics
	scoring and prediction method on the basis of a set of 1,184 DNA
	attributes, which refer to sequence, repeats, predicted structure,
	CpG islands, genes, predicted binding sites, conservation, and single
	nucleotide polymorphisms. These attributes are scored on 132 CpG
	islands across the entire human Chromosome 21, whose methylation
	status was previously established for normal human lymphocytes. Our
	results show that three groups of DNA attributes, namely certain
	sequence patterns, specific DNA repeats, and a particular DNA structure,
	are each highly correlated with CpG island methylation (correlation
	coefficients of 0.64, 0.66, and 0.49, respectively). We predicted,
	and subsequently experimentally examined 12 CpG islands from human
	Chromosome 21 with unknown methylation patterns and found more than
	90\% of our predictions to be correct. In addition, we applied our
	prediction method to analyzing Human Epigenome Project methylation
	data on human Chromosome 6 and again observed high prediction accuracy.
	In summary, our results suggest that DNA composition of CpG islands
	(sequence, repeats, and structure) plays a significant role in predisposing
	CpG islands for DNA methylation. This finding may have a strong impact
	on our understanding of changes in CpG island methylation in development
	and disease.},

	for bioinformatic research is the identification of regulatory regions

	An important class of regulatory regions consists of so-called CpG
	islands, which are characterized by frequent occurrence of the CG
	sequence pattern. CpG islands are strongly associated with open and
	transcriptionally competent chromatin structure, they play a critical
	role in gene regulation, and they are involved in the epigenetic
	causes of cancer. In this article we make several conceptual improvements
	to the definition and mapping of CpG islands. First, we show that
	the traditional distinction between CpG islands and non-CpG islands
	is too harsh, and instead we propose a quantitative measure of CpG
	island strength to gradually distinguish between stronger and weaker
	regulatory regions. Second, by genome-wide comparison of multiple
	epigenome datasets we identify high correlation between features
	of the genome's DNA sequence and the epigenome, indicating strong

	human tumors. However, the conventional analysis of neoplasias has
	preferentially focused on only one of these processes. This approach
	has led to a biased, primarily genetic view, of human tumorigenesis.
	Epigenetic alterations, such as aberrant DNA methylation, are sufficient
	to induce tumor formation, and can modify the incidence, and determine
	the type of tumor which will arise in genetic models of cancer. These
	observations raise important questions about the degree to which
	genetic and epigenetic mechanisms cooperate in human tumorigenesis,
	the identity of the specific cooperating genes and how these genes
	interact functionally to determine the diverse biological and clinical
	paths to tumor initiation and progression. These gaps in our knowledge
	are, in part, due to the lack of methods for full-scale integrated
	genetic and epigenetic analyses. The ultimate goal to fill these
	gaps would include sequencing relevant regions of the 3-billion nucleotide
	genome, and determining the methylation status of the 28-million
	CpG dinucleotide methylome at single nucleotide resolution in different
	types of neoplasias. Here, we review the emergence and advancement

	for regulating gene expression and suppressing spurious transcription.
	Most methods to scan the genome in different tissues for differentially
	methylated sites have focused on the methylation of CpGs in CpG islands,
	which are concentrations of CpGs often associated with gene promoters.
	RESULTS: Here, we use a methylation profiling strategy that is predominantly
	responsive to methylation differences outside of CpG islands. The
	method compares the yield from two samples of size-selected fragments
	generated by a methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme. We then
	profile nine different normal tissues from two human donors relative
	to spleen using a custom array of genomic clones covering the euchromatic
	portion of human chromosome 1 and representing 8\% of the human genome.
	We observe gross regional differences in methylation states across
	chromosome 1 between tissues from the same individual, with the most
	striking differences detected in the comparison of cerebellum and
	spleen. Profiles of the same tissue from different donors are strikingly
	similar, as are the profiles of different lobes of the brain. Comparing
	our results with published gene expression levels, we find that clones
	exhibiting extreme ratios reflecting low relative methylation are
	statistically enriched for genes with high expression ratios, and
	vice versa, in most pairs of tissues examined. CONCLUSION: The varied
	patterns of methylation differences detected between tissues by our
	methylation profiling method reinforce the potential functional significance
	of regional differences in methylation levels outside of CpG islands.},

	Progress has been made in the treatment of hematological malignancies

	with delayed replication, condensed chromatin and inhibition of transcription
	initiation. The investigation of aberrant CpG-island methylation

	has focused on less than 15 of the estimated 45,000 CpG islands in
	the genome. Here we report a global analysis of the methylation status
	of 1,184 unselected CpG islands in each of 98 primary human tumours
	using restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS). We estimate that
	an average of 600 CpG islands (range of 0 to 4,500) of the 45,000
	in the genome were aberrantly methylated in the tumours, including
	early stage tumours. We identified patterns of CpG-island methylation
	that were shared within each tumour type, together with patterns
	and targets that displayed distinct tumour-type specificity. The
	expression of many of these genes was reactivated by experimental

	Methylation patterns of CpG islands are involved in tissue-specific

	with aberrant CpG island methylation is one mechanism leading to
	the loss of tumor suppressor functions in cancer cells. Large-scale
	experimental detection of DNA methylation is still both labor-intensive
	and time-consuming. Therefore, it is necessary to develop in silico
	approaches for predicting methylation status of CpG islands. Results:
	Based on a recent genome-scale dataset of DNA methylation in human
	brain tissues, we developed a classifier called MethCGI for predicting
	methylation status of CpG islands using a support vector machine
	(SVM). Nucleotide sequence contents as well as transcription factor
	binding sites (TFBSs) are used as features for the classification.
	The method achieves specificity of 84.65% and sensitivity of 84.32%
	on the brain data, and can also correctly predict about two-third
	of the data from other tissues reported in the MethDB database. Availability:

	each tumor type is associated with a unique set of methylated genes.
	However, little is known about why certain genes succumb to this
	aberrant event. To address this question, we used Restriction Landmark
	Genome Scanning to analyze the susceptibility of 1,749 unselected
	CpG islands to de novo methylation driven by overexpression of DNA
	cytosine-5-methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1). We found that although the
	overall incidence of CpG island methylation was increased in cells
	overexpressing DNMT1, not all loci were equally affected. The majority
	of CpG islands (69.9\%) were resistant to de novo methylation, regardless
	of DNMT1 overexpression. In contrast, we identified a subset of methylation-prone
	CpG islands (3.8\%) that were consistently hypermethylated in multiple
	DNMT1 overexpressing clones. Methylation-prone and methylation-resistant
	CpG islands were not significantly different with respect to size,
	C+G content, CpG frequency, chromosomal location, or promoter association.
	We used DNA pattern recognition and supervised learning techniques
	to derive a classification function based on the frequency of seven
	novel sequence patterns that was capable of discriminating methylation-prone
	from methylation-resistant CpG islands with 82\% accuracy. The data
	indicate that CpG islands differ in their intrinsic susceptibility

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous RNAs that pair to sites in
	mRNAs to direct post-transcriptional repression. Many sites that
	match the miRNA seed (nucleotides 2-7), particularly those in 3'
	untranslated regions (3'UTRs), are preferentially conserved. Here,
	we overhauled our tool for finding preferential conservation of sequence
	motifs and applied it to the analysis of human 3'UTRs, increasing
	by nearly threefold the detected number of preferentially conserved
	miRNA target sites. The new tool more efficiently incorporates new
	genomes and more completely controls for background conservation
	by accounting for mutational biases, dinucleotide conservation rates,
	and the conservation rates of individual UTRs. The improved background
	model enabled preferential conservation of a new site type, the "offset
	6mer," to be detected. In total, >45,000 miRNA target sites within
	human 3'UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60\% of
	human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to
	maintain pairing to miRNAs. Mammalian-specific miRNAs have far fewer
	conserved targets than do the more broadly conserved miRNAs, even
	when considering only more recently emerged targets. Although pairing
	to the 3' end of miRNAs can compensate for seed mismatches, this
	class of sites constitutes less than 2\% of all preferentially conserved
	sites detected. The new tool enables statistically powerful analysis
	of individual miRNA target sites, with the probability of preferentially
	conserved targeting (P(CT)) correlating with experimental measurements
	of repression. Our expanded set of target predictions (including
	conserved 3'-compensatory sites), are available at the TargetScan
	website, which displays the P(CT) for each site and each predicted
	target.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs have emerged as important regulatory genes in a variety
	of cellular processes and, in recent years, hundreds of such genes
	have been discovered in animals. In contrast, functional annotations
	are available only for a very small fraction of these miRNAs, and
	even in these cases only partially.We developed a general Bayesian
	method for the inference of miRNA target sites, in which, for each
	miRNA, we explicitly model the evolution of orthologous target sites
	in a set of related species. Using this method we predict target
	sites for all known miRNAs in flies, worms, fish, and mammals. By
	comparing our predictions in fly with a reference set of experimentally
	tested miRNA-mRNA interactions we show that our general method performs
	at least as well as the most accurate methods available to date,
	including ones specifically tailored for target prediction in fly.
	An important novel feature of our model is that it explicitly infers
	the phylogenetic distribution of functional target sites, independently
	for each miRNA. This allows us to infer species-specific and clade-specific
	miRNA targeting. We also show that, in long human 3' UTRs, miRNA
	target sites occur preferentially near the start and near the end
	of the 3' UTR. To characterize miRNA function beyond the predicted
	lists of targets we further present a method to infer significant
	associations between the sets of targets predicted for individual
	miRNAs and specific biochemical pathways, in particular those of
	the KEGG pathway database. We show that this approach retrieves several
	known functional miRNA-mRNA associations, and predicts novel functions
	for known miRNAs in cell growth and in development.We have presented
	a Bayesian target prediction algorithm without any tunable parameters,
	that can be applied to sequences from any clade of species. The algorithm
	automatically infers the phylogenetic distribution of functional
	sites for each miRNA, and assigns a posterior probability to each
	putative target site. The results presented here indicate that our
	general method achieves very good performance in predicting miRNA
	target sites, providing at the same time insights into the evolution
	of target sites for individual miRNAs. Moreover, by combining our
	predictions with pathway analysis, we propose functions of specific
	miRNAs in nervous system development, inter-cellular communication
	and cell growth. The complete target site predictions as well as
	the miRNA/pathway associations are accessible on the ElMMo web server.},

	(twist roll, tilt, rise, slide and shift), for each step of the sequence;
	flexibility measures for both decrease and increase in each property
	value from the minimum energy conformation for the central step;

	In an analysis of structural change as a function of sequence length,

	A more detailed analysis of octamer properties has allowed us to
	determine the structural preferences of particular sequence elements.
	GGC and GCC sequences tend to confer bistability, low stability and
	a predisposition to A-form DNA, whereas AA steps strongly prefer
	B-DNA and inhibit A-structures. There is no correlation between flexibility
	and intrinsic curvature, but bent DNA is less stable than straight.
	The most difficult deformation is undertwisting. The TA step stands
	out as the most flexible sequence element with respect to decreasing
	twist and increasing roll. However, as with the structural properties,
	this behavior is highly context-dependent and some TA steps are very

  abstract = {Although vertebrate {DNA} is generally depleted in the dinucleotide
	{CpG,} it has recently been shown that some vertebrate genes contain
	{CpG} islands, regions of {DNA} with a high G + C content and a high
	frequency of {CpG} dinucleotides relative to the bulk genome. In
	this study, a large number of sequences of vertebrate genes were
	screened for the presence of {CpG} islands. Each {CpG} island was
	then analysed in terms of length, nucleotide composition, frequency
	of {CpG} dinucleotides, and location relative to the transcription
	unit of the associated gene. {CpG} islands were associated with the
	5' ends of all housekeeping genes and many tissue-specific genes,
	and with the 3' ends of some tissue-specific genes. A few genes contained
	both 5' and 3' {CpG} islands, separated by several thousand base-pairs
	of {CpG-depleted} {DNA.} The 5' {CpG} islands extended through 5'-flanking
	{DNA,} exons and introns, whereas most of the 3' {CpG} islands appeared
	to be associated with exons. {CpG} islands were generally found in
	the same position relative to the transcription unit of equivalent
	genes in different species, with some notable exceptions. The locations
	of {G/C} boxes, composed of the sequence {GGGCGG} or its reverse
	complement {CCGCCC,} were investigated relative to the location of
	{CpG} islands. {G/C} boxes were found to be rare in {CpG-depleted}
	{DNA} and plentiful in {CpG} islands, where they occurred in 3' {CpG}
	islands, as well as in 5' {CpG} islands associated with tissue-specific
	and housekeeping genes. {G/C} boxes were located both upstream and
	downstream from the transcription start site of genes with 5' {CpG}
	islands. Thus, {G/C} boxes appeared to be a feature of {CpG} islands
	in general, rather than a feature of the promoter region of housekeeping
	genes. Two theories for the maintenance of a high frequency of {CpG}
	dinucleotides in {CpG} islands were tested: that {CpG} islands in
	methylated genomes are maintained, despite a tendency for {5mCpG}
	to mutate by deamination to {TpG} + {CpA,} by the structural stability
	of a high G + C content alone, and that {CpG} islands associated
	with exons result from some selective importance of the arginine
	codon {CGX.} Neither of these theories could account for the distribution
	of {CpG} dinucleotides in the sequences analysed. Possible functions
	of {CpG} islands in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation
	of gene expression were discussed, and were related to theories for
	the maintenance of {CpG} islands as "methylationfree zones" in germline
	{DNA.}},

	unclear. To address this important question, we analyzed histone
	modifications at ICRs in mid-gestation embryos that were obtained
	from Dnmt3L(-/-) females, in which DNA methylation imprints at ICRs
	are not established during oogenesis. The absence of maternal DNA

	and H2A/H4R3me2 histone modifications, providing the first evidence
	of a mechanistic link between DNA and histone methylation at ICRs.
	The existence of this relationship was strengthened by the observation
	that when DNA methylation was still present at the Snrpn and Peg3
	ICRs in some of the progeny of Dnmt3L(-/-) females, these ICRs were
	associated with the usual patterns of histone methylation. Combined,

  abstract = {Histone acetyltransferases are associated with the elongating RNA
	polymerase II (Pol II) complex, supporting the idea that histone
	acetylation and transcription are intertwined mechanistically in
	gene coding sequences. Here, we studied the establishment and function
	of histone acetylation and transcription in noncoding sequences by
	using a model locus linking the beta-globin HS2 enhancer and the
	embryonic epsilon-globin gene in chromatin. An intact HS2 enhancer
	that recruits RNA Pol II is required for intergenic transcription
	and histone H3 acetylation and K4 methylation between the enhancer
	and target gene. RNA Pol II recruitment to the target gene TATA box
	is not required for the intergenic transcription or intergenic histone
	modifications, strongly implying that they are properties conferred
	by the enhancer. However, Pol II recruitment at HS2, intergenic transcription,
	and intergenic histone modification are not sufficient for transcription
	or modification of the target gene: these changes require initiation
	at the TATA box of the gene. The results suggest that intergenic
	and genic transcription complexes are independent and possibly differ
	from one another.},

  title = {Predicting DNA methylation susceptibility using CpG flanking sequences},
  journal = {Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing},
  year = {2008},
  pages = {315--326},
  abstract = {DNA methylation is a type of chemical modification of DNA that adds
	a methyl group to DNA at the fifth carbon of the cytosine pyrimidine
	ring. In normal cells, methylation of CpG dinucleotides is extensively
	found across the genome. However, specific DNA regions known as the
	CpG islands, short CpG dinucleotide-rich stretches (500 bp - 2000bp),
	are commonly unmethylated. During tumorigenesis, on the other hand,
	global de-methylation and CpG island hypermethylation are widely
	observed. De novo hypermethylation at CpG dinucleotides is typically
	associated with loss of expression of flanking genes, thus it is
	believed to be an alternative to mutation and deletion in the inactivation
	of tumor suppressor genes. In this paper, we report that sequences
	flanking CpG sites can be used for predicting DNA methylation levels.
	DNA methylation levels were measured by utilizing a new high throughput
	sequencing technology (454) to sequence bisulfite treated DNA from
	four types of primary leukemia and lymphoma cells and normal peripheral
	blood lymphocytes. After measuring methylation levels at each CpG
	site, we used 30 bp flanking sequences to characterize methylation
	susceptibility in terms of character compositions and built predictive
	models for DNA methylation susceptibility, achieving up to 75% prediction
	accuracy in 10-fold cross validation tests. Our study is first of
	its kind to build predictive models for methylation susceptibility
	by utilizing CpG site specific methylation levels.},

	and KB cell lines by using cleavage with methylation-sensitive restriction
	enzymes combined with Southern blot hybridization and by using genomic
	sequencing. The results can be summarized as follows. (i) In differentiated
	primary human cells, Alu elements are often highly methylated even
	when they are in very 5'-CG-3'-rich regions. This finding is not
	consistent with the notion that hypermethylation would be a sufficient
	condition in itself for 5'-CG-3' sequences to undergo loss of 5-methyl-deoxycytidine
	(5-mC) due to deamination and subsequent mutation. (ii) There are
	distinct differences in the levels of methylation in the specific
	Alu sequences. (iii) Alu elements in the DNA of haploid spermatozoa
	are much less methylated than in diploid cells. Preliminary data
	indicate that spermatozoa contain Alu-specific RNAs. (iv) The results
	of cell-free transcription experiments with Alu elements suggest
	that the in vitro transcription of Alu elements can be inhibited
	by 5'-CG-3' methylation. High levels of 5'-CG-3' methylation in Alu
	elements could contribute to their general transcriptional inactivity.
	(v) The patterns of methylation observed in the Alu elements and
	in the surrounding sequences are characterized by cell type specific

	disassemble nucleosomes and promote histone acetylation. Set2 is
	an H3 K36 methyltransferase. The functions of these proteins intersect
	in the context of transcription elongation by RNA polymerase II:
	both contribute to the establishment of repressive chromatin structures
	that inhibit spurious intragenic transcription. Here we characterize
	further interactions between budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae)
	Asf1 and Set2 using assays of intragenic transcription, H3/H4 posttranslational
	modification, coding region cross-linking of Asf1 and Set2, and cooccurrence
	of Asf1 and Set2 in protein complexes. We find that at some genes
	Asf1 and Set2 control chromatin metabolism as components of separate
	pathways. However, the existence of a low-abundance complex containing
	both proteins suggests that Asf1 and Set2 can more directly collaborate
	in chromatin regulation. Consistent with this possibility, we show
	that Asf1 stimulates Set2 occupancy of the coding region of a highly
	transcribed gene by a mechanism that depends on Asf1 binding to H3/H4.
	This function of Asf1 promotes the switch from di- to trimethylation
	of H3 K36 at that gene. These results support the view that Set2
	function in chromatin metabolism can intimately involve histone chaperone

	in mammals remains limited. Here we report the generation and analysis
	of genome-scale DNA methylation profiles at nucleotide resolution
	in mammalian cells. Using high-throughput reduced representation
	bisulphite sequencing and single-molecule-based sequencing, we generated
	DNA methylation maps covering most CpG islands, and a representative
	sampling of conserved non-coding elements, transposons and other
	genomic features, for mouse embryonic stem cells, embryonic-stem-cell-derived
	and primary neural cells, and eight other primary tissues. Several
	key findings emerge from the data. First, DNA methylation patterns
	are better correlated with histone methylation patterns than with
	the underlying genome sequence context. Second, methylation of CpGs
	are dynamic epigenetic marks that undergo extensive changes during
	cellular differentiation, particularly in regulatory regions outside
	of core promoters. Third, analysis of embryonic-stem-cell-derived
	and primary cells reveals that 'weak' CpG islands associated with
	a specific set of developmentally regulated genes undergo aberrant
	hypermethylation during extended proliferation in vitro, in a pattern
	reminiscent of that reported in some primary tumours. More generally,
	the results establish reduced representation bisulphite sequencing
	as a powerful technology for epigenetic profiling of cell populations
	relevant to developmental biology, cancer and regenerative medicine.},

  abstract = {Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are two major de novo DNA methyltransferases essential
	for embryonic development in mammals. It has been shown that Dnmt3a
	and Dnmt3b have distinct substrate preferences for certain genomic
	loci, including major and minor satellite repeats. However, the exact
	target CpG sites where Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b catalyze DNA methylation
	remains largely unknown. To identify a CpG site that is specifically
	methylated by Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b, we screened methylated genomic loci
	by methylation sensitive restriction fingerprinting using genomic
	DNA from wild-type, Dnmt3a null, Dnmt3b null, and Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double
	null ES cells. Interestingly, one of the CpG sites was preferentially
	methylated in wild-type and Dnmt3b null ES cells but not in Dnmt3a
	null or Dnmt3a-Dnmt3b double null ES cells, suggesting that the site-specific
	methylation was Dnmt3a-dependent. Sequencing results revealed that
	the isolated CpG site is located within the 1st exon of the G isoform
	of fibroblast growth factor (Fgf-1.G) on mouse chromosome 18. Exogenous
	expression of Dnmt3a but not Dnmt3b in the double null ES cells restored
	DNA methylation of this CpG site. When we examined alternative transcription
	initiation sites, we determined that another CpG site in the 5'-flanking
	region of the Fgf-1.A isoform was also methylated specifically by
	Dnmt3a. Using chimeric constructs between Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b, we further
	determined that the NH(2)-terminal regulatory domain of Dnmt3a was
	responsible for establishing its substrate specificity. These results
	indicate that certain CpG sites within the Fgf-1 gene locus are preferentially
	methylated by Dnmt3a but not by Dnmt3b. Selective methylation by
	a specific member of Dnmt3 may therefore play a role in the orchestration
	of gene expression during embryonic development.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:The computational prediction of DNA methylation has become
	an important topic in the recent years due to its role in the epigenetic
	control of normal and cancer-related processes. While previous prediction
	approaches focused merely on differences between methylated and unmethylated
	DNA sequences, recent experimental results have shown the presence
	of much more complex patterns of methylation across tissues and time
	in the human genome. These patterns are only partially described
	by a binary model of DNA methylation. In this work we propose a novel
	approach, based on profile analysis of tissue-specific methylation
	that uncovers significant differences in the sequences of CpG islands
	(CGIs) that predispose them to a tissue- specific methylation pattern.RESULTS:We
	defined CGI methylation profiles that separate not only between constitutively
	methylated and unmethylated CGIs, but also identify CGIs showing
	a differential degree of methylation across tissues and cell-types
	or a lack of methylation exclusively in sperm. These profiles are
	clearly distinguished by a number of CGI attributes including their
	evolutionary conservation, their significance, as well as the evolutionary
	evidence of prior methylation. Additionally, we assess profile functionality
	with respect to the different compartments of protein coding genes
	and their possible use in the prediction of DNA methylation.CONCLUSION:Our
	approach provides new insights into the biological features that
	determine if a CGI has a functional role in the epigenetic control
	of gene expression and the features associated with CGI methylation
	susceptibility. Moreover, we show that the ability to predict CGI
	methylation is based primarily on the quality of the biological information
	used and the relationships uncovered between different sources of
	knowledge. The strategy presented here is able to predict, besides
	the constitutively methylated and unmethylated classes, two more
	tissue specific methylation classes conserving the accuracy provided
	by leading binary methylation classification methods.},

	cytosines for normal function, but the relationship between genomic
	methylation patterns and the underlying sequence is unclear. We have
	characterized the methylation landscape of the human genome by global
	analysis of patterns of CpG depletion and by direct sequencing of
	3073 unmethylated domains and 2565 methylated domains from human
	brain DNA. The genome was found to consist of short (<4 kb) unmethylated
	domains embedded in a matrix of long methylated domains. Unmethylated
	domains were enriched in promoters, CpG islands, and first exons,
	while methylated domains comprised interspersed and tandem-repeated
	sequences, exons other than first exons, and non-annotated single-copy
	sequences that are depleted in the CpG dinucleotide. The enrichment
	of regulatory sequences in the relatively small unmethylated compartment
	suggests that cytosine methylation constrains the effective size
	of the genome through the selective exposure of regulatory sequences.
	This buffers regulatory networks against changes in total genome
	size and provides an explanation for the C value paradox, which concerns
	the wide variations in genome size that scale independently of gene
	number. This suggestion is compatible with the finding that cytosine
	methylation is universal among large-genome eukaryotes, while many
	eukaryotes with genome sizes <5 × 10 bp do not methylate their DNA.},

	different functional categories. In vertebrates, HCEs are associated
	with the 3' UTRs of regulatory genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized
	regions rich in moderately conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding

	on genetic alterations but on an abnormal cellular memory, or epigenetic
	changes, which convey heritable gene expression patterns critical
	for neoplastic initiation and progression. These aberrant epigenetic
	mechanisms are manifest in both global changes in chromatin packaging
	and in localized gene promoter changes that influence the transcription
	of genes important to the cancer process. An exciting emerging theme
	is that an understanding of stem cell chromatin control of gene expression,
	including relationships between histone modifications and DNA methylation,
	may hold a key to understanding the origins of cancer epigenetic
	changes. This possibility, coupled with the reversible nature of
	epigenetics, has enormous significance for the prevention and control
	of cancer.},

	up to +/-four base-pairs surrounding the central CG site that are
	characteristic of high (5'-CTTGCGCAAG-3') and low (5'-TGTTCGGTGG-3')
	levels of methylation in human genomic DNA. We have investigated
	the influence of flanking sequence on the catalytic activity of the
	Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b de novo DNA methyltransferases using a set of synthetic
	oligonucleotide substrates that covers all possible +/-1 flanks in
	quantitative terms. Methylation kinetics experiments revealed a >13-fold
	difference between the preferred (RCGY) and disfavored +/-1 flanking
	base-pairs (YCGR). In addition, AT-rich flanks are preferred over
	GC-rich ones. These experimental preferences coincide with the genomic
	methylation patterns. Therefore, we have expanded our experimental
	analysis and found a >500-fold difference in the methylation rates
	of the consensus sequences for high and low levels of methylation
	in the genome. This result demonstrates a very pronounced flanking
	sequence preference of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. It suggests that the methylation
	pattern of human DNA is due, in part, to the flanking sequence preferences
	of the de novo DNA MTases and that flanking sequence preferences
	could be involved in the origin of CG islands. Furthermore, similar
	flanking sequence preferences have been found for the stimulation
	of the immune system by unmethylated CGs, suggesting a co-evolution
	of DNA MTases and the immune system.},

	encoded in the DNA, but also of epigenetic information including
	DNA methylation and histone modifications. As such histone modifications
	are involved in many aspects of nuclear processes including gene
	regulation and chromosome segregation. Recently, a 'histone code'
	hypothesis was put forward to explain how patterns of histone modification
	may function in downstream processes. In support of the 'histone
	code' hypothesis, we found in vivo and in vitro evidence that effector
	proteins, HP1 (heterochromatin protein 1) and Pc (Polycomb) can discriminate
	and 'read' histone methylation marks on K9 and K27, respectively.
	Moreover, we propose a 'binary switch' model and suggest that binding
	and release of effector proteins to their cognate sites can be regulated
	by modifications on adjacent or nearby residues. Thus, combinations
	of adjacent histone modifications would function differently from
	singular modification, and static modifications (e.g. Lys methylation)
	may well be regulated by dynamic modifications (e.g. phosphorylation).
	Finally, we describe a novel histone phosphorylation event linking
	the function of Mst1 kinase and H2B Ser14 phosphorylation with apoptotic
	chromatin condensation in vertebrates. As this modification is not
	found during mitotic chromosome condensation, these findings suggest
	the intriguing possibility that a unique 'death' mark exists for
	chromatin condensation during apoptosis.},

	been introduced to exclude Alu repeats, thereby enabling a higher
	proportion of CpG islands associating with genes to be identified.
	Using these new criteria, several types of associations between CpG
	islands and genes were investigated to further establish the importance
	of CpG islands as gene markers. RESULTS: The CpG islands were searched
	by CpGIE, a java software program developed for CpG island identification.
	CpGIE was advanced in identification accuracy compared with other
	tools. According to our results, about 70\% of the identified CpG
	islands were associating with the human genes and over half of them
	are in the promoters. Furthermore, the investigation of genes in
	the confirmed gene model showed that 56\% of them had a CpG island
	overlapping the transcription start sites. In comparison, the new
	criteria were found capable of filtering a large fraction of Alu
	repeats that was identified as CpG islands by the generally accepted
	criteria within the genes, but very few CpG islands associating with
	the promoters were affected. The genes in the predicted gene model
	were not obviously associated with CpG islands, suggesting that CpG
	islands can be used to evaluate the accuracy of gene annotation.

	modifications of the histone proteins. DNA methylation plays important
	roles in development and disease processes. To investigate the biological
	role of DNA methylation, we analyzed DNA methylation patterns of
	190 gene promoter regions on chromosome 21 in five human cell types.
	Our results show that average DNA methylation levels are distributed
	bimodally with enrichment of highly methylated and unmethylated sequences,
	indicating that DNA methylation acts in a switch-like manner. Consistent
	with the well-established role of DNA methylation in gene silencing,
	we found DNA methylation in promoter regions strongly correlated
	with absence of gene expression and low levels of additional activating
	epigenetic marks. Although methylation levels of individual cells
	in one tissue are very similar, we observed differences in DNA methylation
	when comparing different cell types in 43% of all regions analyzed.
	This finding is in agreement with a role of DNA methylation in cellular
	development. We identified three cases of genes that are differentially
