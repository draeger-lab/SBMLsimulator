  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  
  The program SBMLsimulator provides a convenient and self-explanatory graphical
  user interface for its numerical simulation core, the
  <a href="http://simulation-core.sourceforge.net">Systems Biology Simulation
  Core Library</a>.
  In addition, it links the capabilities of this library to the powerful
  nature-inspired heuristic optimization framework
  <a href="http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/EvA2/">EvA2</a>.
  This combination allows users to calibrate models encoded in the
  <a href="http://sbml.org">Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)</a>
  to experimental data. Specialized parsers for character-separated values can
  be used to read these experimental data.
  The full functionality of the program can also be used from the command line.
  Hence, SBMLsimulator can be used to calibrate models in a large scale without
  the need of user interaction. Finally, this document gives you an overview
  about SBMLsimulator's application programming interface (API), so that you can
  incorporate the program into your own Java&trade;-based work flow.
  Summarizing, SBMLsimulator is a versatile program for the simulation of models
  in systems biology that can be used in diverse ways.
