As explained in the JAMA web page, NIST and the MathWorks have
given JAMA to the public domain.  In doing so they have relinquished
all rights to the software.  It is not burdened by any licensing
restrictions.  It can be used for any purpose whatsoever.

An acknowledgement to the MathWorks and NIST for developing the
package would be appreciated, however.
